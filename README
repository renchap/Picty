Picty is a small Ruby/Rack application to display your pictures online.

Website: http://github.com/renchap/Picty
IRC Channel: #picty @ Freenode

All directories in public/pictures are your albums, put your pictures in it and that is all. You can also create sub-directories to organize your albums better.

Thumbnails are generated on-the-fly when the album is seen for the first time, and stored in public/thumbs.

== Install ==
To install Picty, you need Ruby (tested with 1.8.7 and 1.9.2) and the bundler gem.

Picty is a standard Rack application. You only need to download (or clone) Picty from GitHub (http://github.com/renchap/Picty), run "bundle install" in the Picty directory to install dependancies, and then configure your webserver to run the application.

For exemple, if you use passenger, you only need to point your document root to Picty's public/ directory in your Picty Virtualhost, and restart your web server.

== Contributing ==
